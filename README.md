## 🛠️ Built With Love (and a bit of frustration)

- React (because who doesn't love a good component these days?)
- CSS (making things pretty since... well, a long time ago)
- A sprinkle of JavaScript magic ✨

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run (Away with) This Project

1. Clone this repo (don't worry, it won't clone itself like a creepy sci-fi movie)
2. Navigate to the project directory (you can do it, I believe in you!)
3. Run `npm install` (watch as your computer pretends to be busy)
4. Start the development server with `npm start`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser (if it doesn't work, try turning it off and on again)

---

## 🎯 How to Play (and Potentially Win)

1. Click on an emoji. Any emoji. Don't be shy!
2. Remember that emoji. Your life depends on it. (Not really, but play along)
3. Click another unique emoji. Repeat until you've clicked all 12 without repeating.
4. If you click a repeat, game over! But don't worry, you can always blame it on your "slow internet connection."
